## What is it?

Scally core is the foundation of a project's UI build providing things like:

- Sensible global styles, [see here](#base).
- Global settings (Sass variables), [see here](#settings).
- Handy Sass functions and mixins, [see here](#functions) and [here](#mixins).
- Global Sass silent placeholder selectors, [see here](#placeholders).
- A powerful reset, [see here](#_reset.scss), and Normalize.scss, [see here](#_normalize.scss).
- Debug styles, [see here](#_debug.scss).

Without core Scally won't work. It is the only mandatory part of the framework.




## The breakdown

Core is broken down into the following sections:

- [Base](#base)
- [Functions](#functions)
- [Mixins](#mixins)
- [Placeholders](#placeholders)
- [Settings](#settings)

And a few things not sectioned:

- [_debug.scss](#_debug.scss)
- [_normalize.scss](#_normalize.scss)
- [_reset.scss](#_reset.scss)

### Base

The base section provides very basic styling that most UI's will need. These styles are applied at the most global level, with most being applied via element selectors e.g.

```
p { ... }
```

```
a { ... }
```

Everything in base needs to be easily overridden. This is really easy to do as everything in base sits right at the bottom in terms of Scally's specificity (CSS' first C; the cascade), [see](#specificity).

#### Sensible styles

Base styles try to be as unopinionated as possible—like most things in Scally—with most applying *sensible* styles that you'd expect to find in a user agent stylesheet, like:

- Applying `cursor: help` to abbreviations (`abbr`) that have a `title` attribute.
- Applying `cursor: pointer` to `summary` and `label` elements.
- Removing the gap between media elements (`img`, `video`, `audio`, etc) and the bottom of their containers.
- Applying a bottom margin to all paragraphs (`p`) of text.

The more opinionated styles found in base sit behind a [toggle](settings/_toggles.scss) meaning you decide if you want to use them or not.

#### Normalize.css-esque styles

Base also provides [Normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)-esque styles like:

- Set the default behavior for touch-based browsing in IE 10 on devices running Windows 8.
- Remove rounded corners from iOS search inputs.
- Remove rounded corners from iOS `input` buttons.
- Remove the top inner shadow from iOS inputs. **[optional]**
- Hide the close button generated by IE 10+ for inputs. **[optional]**

Some of the above are actual Normalize.css overrides.

#### Other noteworthy parts of base

##### Responsive images

Scally—being a responsive ready framework—sets all image elements (`img`) to be responsive by default:

```
img {
  @if $responsive-images {
    max-width: 100%;
    height: auto;
  }
}
```

However this is optional, sitting behind the `$responsive-images` toggle.

##### Print

Scally provides some *sensible* global print styles, with most taken from the [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/src/css/main.css) print styles.

All print styles that aren't defined at this global base level will live in context with their corresponding rule sets.

##### Root

Root defines styles for the `html` element. It mainly focuses on typography styles e.g. setting font size, font family, line height, etc. Root also defines the global foreground colour which is inherited by all HTML elements, and the background colour of the `html` element itself.

##### Forms

Scally provides quite a few base form styles. Most are concerned with applying [*sensible* styles](#sensible-styles) and [Normalize.css-esque styles](#normalize-css-esque-styles).

The other two main parts of forms are concerned with providing styles for text inputs (including `textarea`) and `select` lists, and a disabled state for **ALL** HTML form elements. These styles, being fairly oppinionated, are all optional, sitting behind the `$disabled-state` and `$text-input-and-select-styles` toggles.




### Functions

Scally features a bunch of handy Sass functions to keep the framework more readable and DRY, by abstracting any common reusable logic.

The [**Convert `px` to `em-rem`**](core/functions/_convert-px-to-em-rem.scss) function is the most used and powerful and does what it says on the tin: *To convert pixels to either the `em` or `rem` units*. There is also a [**Convert `px` to `em-rem`**](core/mixins/_convert-px-to-em-rem.scss) mixin which is dependant on this function.

**Function**

```
margin-left: to-em(8);
```

**Mixin**

```
@include to-em(margin-left, 8);
```

The [Math helpers](core/functions/_math-helpers.scss) contain a handful of math helper functions which are used to quickly create size variants of property values, e.g.

```
padding: halve(3.2px);
```




### Mixins

Scally features quite a few powerful Sass mixins. These mixins underpin and are **required** for many parts of the Scally framework.

The most used and powerful Scally mixins are:

- [Convert `px` to `em-rem`](core/mixins/_convert-px-to-em-rem.scss)

  *some examples:*
  ```
  @include to-em(line-height, 30);

  @include to-em(width height, 125);

  @include to-rem(box-shadow, (inset 0 0 0 1 #2a9022) (inset 0 0 3 #459966));
  ```
- [Font size](core/mixins/_font-size.scss)

  *some examples:*
  ```
  @include font-size(18);

  @include font-size(12, 1.5);

  @include font-size(12, none);

  @include font-size(24, inherit);

  @include font-size(24, normal);
  ```
- [Generate at breakpoints](core/mixins/_generate-at-breakpoints.scss)

  *some examples:*
  ```
  @include generate-at-breakpoints('.u-text-size-small', all) {
     @include font-size($font-size-small);
   }

   @include generate-at-breakpoints('.u-demo{bp} li', palm lap) {
     vertical-align: top;
   }
   ```
- [Media queries](core/mixins/_media-queries.scss)

  *some examples:*
  ```
  @include respond-to(lap) {
    .foo {background: red;}
  }

  @include respond-to(500) {
    .foo {background: red;}
  }

  @include respond-to(palm, max) {
    .foo {background: red;}
  }

  @include respond-to(500, $axis: height) {
    .foo {background: red;}
  }

  @include respond-range(500, 780) {
    .foo {background: red;}
  }

  @include respond-range(lap) {
    .foo {background: red;}
  }
  ```

All of Scally's mixins—bar one—accept arguments which is a good way to use a Sass mixin as argument-less mixins are typically only used as containers for common CSS rules which isn't very optimal e.g. DRY. Scally negates the need for argument-less mixins through it's [utilities](../utilities/) and in certain cases it's [Sass silent placeholder selectors](#placeholders).
