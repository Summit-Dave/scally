## What is it?

Scally core is the foundation of a project's UI build providing things like:

- Sensible global styles, [see here](#base).
- Global settings (Sass variables), [see here](#settings).
- Handy Sass functions and mixins, [see here](#functions) and [here](#mixins).
- Global Sass silent placeholder selectors, [see here](#placeholders).
- A powerful reset, [see here](#_reset.scss), and Normalize.scss, [see here](#_normalize.scss).
- Debug styles, [see here](#_debug.scss).

Without core Scally won't work. It is the only mandatory part of the framework.




## The breakdown

Core is broken down into the following sections:

- [Base](#base)
- [Functions](#functions)
- [Mixins](#mixins)
- [Placeholders](#placeholders)
- [Settings](#settings)

And a few things not sectioned:

- [_debug.scss](#_debug.scss)
- [_normalize.scss](#_normalize.scss)
- [_reset.scss](#_reset.scss)

### Base

The base section provides very basic styling that most UI's will need. These styles are applied at the most global level with most being applied via element selectors e.g.

```
p { ... }
```

```
a { ... }
```

Everything in base needs to be easily overridden, this is a very easy thing to do as they carry such low specificity, [see](#specificity).

Base styles try to be as unopinionated as possible—like most things in Scally—with most applying *sensible* styles that you'd expect to find in a user agent stylesheet, like:

- Applying `cursor: help` to abbreviations (`abbr`) that have a `title` attribute.
- Applying `cursor: pointer` to `summary` and `label` elements.
- Removing the gap between media elements (`img`, `video`, `audio`, etc) and the bottom of their containers.
- Applying a bottom margin to all paragraphs (`p`) of text.

Base also provides [Normalize.css-esque](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) styles like:

- Set the default behavior for touch-based browsing in IE 10 on devices running Windows 8.
- Remove rounded corners from iOS search inputs.
- Remove rounded corners that iOS applies to all `input` buttons.
- Remove the top inner shadow from iOS inputs. **[optional]**
- Hide the close button generated by IE 10+ for inputs. **[optional]**

Some of the above are actual Normalize.css overrides.

The more opinionated styles found in base are mostly behind a [toggle](settings/_toggles.scss) meaning you decide if you want to use them or not.

Some other noteworthy parts of base:

#### Responsive images

#### Print styles

#### Forms

#### Root

#### Typography

Core acts like the foundation of your project providing important things like:

- Global settings (variables) to house all common styles to keep your CSS
  nicely organised, maintainable, and DRY. And every setting can easily be overridden allowing you to have absolute control. **[Demo](http://codepen.io/team/westfieldlabs/full/aLDdb)**.
- [Normalize](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/).
- In addition to Normalize a reset to remove the default spacing and border
  from *ALL* HTML elements to make everything a level playing field. The reset does other things like remove default bullets from lists and change the `box-sizing` property to the more friendly `border-box` value (although this is optional). **[Demo](http://codepen.io/team/westfieldlabs/full/wGvdp)**.
- Debug styles to detect any improperly nested or potentially invalid markup,
  or any potentially inaccessible code. **[Demo](http://codepen.io/team/westfieldlabs/full/GHzvE)**.
- Handy Sass functions and mixins to make writing CSS easier and DRY*ey*.
  **[Demo](http://codepen.io/team/westfieldlabs/full/Bcfyz)**.
- Unclassed base styles which set the core styles for the main HTML elements
  of a project e.g. `a`, `h1-h6`, `p`, etc. These styles have a very low specificity so they can easily be overridden. **[Demo](http://codepen.io/team/westfieldlabs/full/zIgBs)**.
